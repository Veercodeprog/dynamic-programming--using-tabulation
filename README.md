# dynamic-programming--using-tabulation

**TABULATION**
I am excited to announce the creation of a repository that focuses on the tabulation approach of dynamic programming. As someone who loves this method, I appreciate how it efficiently solves complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing solutions in a table or matrix. I believe this approach provides the best time complexity for most problems, even if it requires slightly more time than some other solutions.

**To implement the tabulation method, the following steps can be followed:**

1.)Visualize the problem as a table

2.)Determine the size of the table based on the inputs

3.)Initialize the table with default values

4.)Seed the table with the base case or trivial answer

5.)Iterate through the table

6.)Fill further positions based on the current position

Inside the "dynamic programming" subfolder of the repository, there are various problems and their solutions that can be solved using the tabulation method. I encourage contributions to this repository and the addition of new problems and solutions using this efficient approach.

you can add your problems directly by adding links to this file or adding your solution for any problem in any language of your choice in a folder.
